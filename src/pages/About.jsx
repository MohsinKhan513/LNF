                            LostNoMore is dedicated to reuniting lost items with their rightful owners within the
                            FAST National University community. We believe that losing personal belongings shouldn't
                            mean losing them forever.

                        <p>
                            LostNoMore was created by students who experienced the frustration of losing valuable
                            items on campus. We recognized the need for a better system than traditional lost and
                            found boxes or social media posts that quickly get buried.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By leveraging modern technology and creating an intuitive platform, we've made it
                            easier than ever to report, search, and recover lost items within our university community.
